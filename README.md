# VALA2016 ORCID Boot Camp
## Hands on with the ORCID API 

This bootcamp provides a hands-on tutorial for using the ORCID Member and Public APIs. After a brief introduction to ORCID and how to encourage your researchers to get and use an ORCID iD, the workshop will be divided into two sections:

Section 1: What is the ORCID API? Using the ORCID Public API
* About the ORCID APIs
* Accessing the Public API
* Using the Public API (searching ORCID records, getting an authenticated ORCID iD)

Section 2: Getting started with the ORCID member API
* Accessing the Member API
* Getting permission to edit users’ ORCID records via OAuth
* Reading from/writing to users’ ORDCID records via the Member API

This workshop requires a laptop. All skill levels are welcome; software development experience is not required.
